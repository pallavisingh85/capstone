# Travel Planner App Project

## Overview
This project requires you to build out a travel app that, at a minimum, obtains a desired trip location & date from the user, and displays weather and an image of the location using information obtained from external APIs. Given that this is the Capstone project, it's highly encouraged for you to go above and beyond, adding additional functionality and customization to truly stand out with a project you are proud to have at the top of your portfolio.

## Instructions
This will require modifying the `server.js` file and the `website/app.js` file. You can see `index.html` for element references, and once you are finished with the project steps, you can use `style.css` to style your application to customized perfection.

## Extras
If you are interested in testing your code as you go, you can use `tests.js` as a template for writing and running some basic tests for your code.
